# Pong
Classic Pong game with a little twist. EXE file for demo

Stylized to be similar to the original Pong game for Atari, but the twist is the ball gets faster and faster during a round! It only resets when someone has scored a point and the next round has started

Two player game. Left paddle moves with W and S keys, right paddle moves with up and down arrow
